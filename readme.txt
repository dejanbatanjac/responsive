Resizes any non responsive web site, and makes it responsive with the simple trick of CSS scaling achieved using jQuery

== Description ==
This simple WordPress plugin inserts smart jQuery code to your website header and makes old, non-responsive web sites automatically responsive. It doesn't use Bootstrap, nor any responsive grid system.

The only requirement is JavaScript (jQuery) being enabled in your browser. If no JavaScrpt enabled, then the plugin will not have any impact.
